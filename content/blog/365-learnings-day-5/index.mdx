import { Aside } from '../../../src/components/aside';

4/365 learnings for the year.

I built an aside component to display extra information in my posts. This is what it looks like:

<Aside>
  <p>This is my aside!</p>
  <p>
    I will be using these to display information in a post that might be
    slightly tangential to the core topic of the post - however, it might be
    handy for you to know!
  </p>
</Aside>

<br />

I'll probably add some customisation to it, like a little icon, or different backgrounds depending on the sort of information that is being display, but for now this works.

It's also a nice use of the semantic `aside` element!
