description: A quick runthrough of adding MDX to my Gatsby blog

4/365 learnings for the year.

Today is a quick one. I went through the [docs on how to add MDX to an existing Gatsby blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2019-11-21-how-to-convert-an-existing-gatsby-blog-to-use-mdx/) and I was able to add MDX to my blog with relative ease!

The came about because I sat down to do another post about a neat component I wanted to add to the blog to help communicate key points across better and then realised it would be best if I could just show it and talk about it. However, I had no nice way of embedding it on the page without needing to do something like embed a Codepen.

Very much looking forward to tomorrow's post!
