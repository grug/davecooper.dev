Today when working with Webpack module federation, I discovered that you can use a version range with the requiredVersion property.

Previously, I thought you could _only_ provide a version number, but you can also use a range.

If we know what the minimum and maximum compatible version ranges are for a given shared library, then we can provide them and save ourselves loading those modules multiple times.

Take for example:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ... the rest of our webpack config
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'Foo',
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      exposes: {
        './Foo': './src/Foo',
      },
      shared: {
        someLib: {
          singleton: true,
          requiredVersion: '>=1.0.0 <3.1.0',
          strictVersion: true,
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

This means that `someLib` will load just once if the version is greater than or equal to `1.0.0` and less than `3.1.0`. The `strictVersion` flag will mean the application throws if the library version doesn't match that range.
