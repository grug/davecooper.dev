5/365 learnings for the year.

Today I needed to record some content around Webpack module federation - mainly around how it works and how you set it up.

I hadn't actually set up a decent screen recording environment where I could have a video in the corner of the screen and my code taking up the rest of the screen.
Fortunately I remember reading a couple of blog posts last year about some pretty slick looking setups for streaming live-coding on Twitch:

- [Suz Hinton's Twitch streaming setup blog post](https://medium.com/@suzhinton/my-twitch-live-coding-setup-b2516672fb21)
- [Jordan Lewis' Twitch streaming setup blog post](https://jordanlewis.org/posts/twitch-live-coding/)

Between these two posts, it gave me enough information to get the video recording side of things set up. I went with the same software they used - [OBS studio](https://obsproject.com/).

From there I just needed some software to do some minor edits to the video - a quick Google led me to [Lightworks](https://lwks.com/). Their introductory tutorial video gave me more than enough information I needed to do my editing.

I'm really happy with the results of this. I'll definitely be using this setup for more coding tutorial videos and now it's making me want to stream some live-coding on Twitch!

Once I get more comofortable with this setup, I'll make my own post about my setup.
