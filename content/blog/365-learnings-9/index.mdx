<Aside>9/365 learnings for the year.</Aside>

<br />

This is a very quick one.

I'm a little bit late to the party, but I only discovered today that you can create new Google docs/sheets/etc... by typing `docs.new` or `sheets.new` into your address bar.

It works for a bunch of other Google files, too. The [original Tweet about it](https://twitter.com/googledocs/status/1055490445088903168) is from 2018 - something something new dog, old tricks!
