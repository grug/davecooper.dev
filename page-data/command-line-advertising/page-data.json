At the moment, using <a href=\"https://chimp.readme.io/\">Chimp</a> alongside <a href=\"https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js\">Cucumber</a> for writing end-to-end tests is pretty nice, in my opinion. We use it at my current workplace and it’s great. However, this looks like a recent interesting play from the Chimp crew.</p>\n<p>Now for the fun stuff.</p>\n<p>After installing Chimp on a new machine and going to execute it, I noticed something a little different to what I’m used to seeing when running command line utilities… see if you can spot it - you’ll need a keen eye.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8f2a0d653d6c76214d03575cdbfa69bb/b6e58/chimp.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 12.162162162162163%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Chimp Terminal\"\n        title=\"Chimp Terminal\"\n        src=\"/static/8f2a0d653d6c76214d03575cdbfa69bb/1c72d/chimp.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8f2a0d653d6c76214d03575cdbfa69bb/a80bd/chimp.jpg 148w,\n/static/8f2a0d653d6c76214d03575cdbfa69bb/1c91a/chimp.jpg 295w,\n/static/8f2a0d653d6c76214d03575cdbfa69bb/1c72d/chimp.jpg 590w,\n/static/8f2a0d653d6c76214d03575cdbfa69bb/a8a14/chimp.jpg 885w,\n/static/8f2a0d653d6c76214d03575cdbfa69bb/fbd2c/chimp.jpg 1180w,\n/static/8f2a0d653d6c76214d03575cdbfa69bb/b6e58/chimp.jpg 1430w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Yep, you guessed it - advertising has infected your precious, pristine, pure terminal! Although I’m not sure how pure that hamburger terminal of mine is…</p>\n<p>This took me by surprise. As far as I can recall, I don’t think I’ve seen links shoved in front of the user that lead to paid services.</p>\n<p>Let me also say here that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I love Chimp.</li>\n<li>I think their developers do a great job.</li>\n<li>I’m not sure I think this is necessarily a bad thing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It does leave me quite confused, though. Could we start to see this happening more often? We all use command line tools all the time - why not start putting things into our eyeline?</p>\n<p>I tried Googling for examples of this but wasn’t able to find anything substantial. Maybe I am way behind the 8-ball on this one and it’s happened at scale before.</p>\n<p>What sort of things could this lead to? Answer: I’m not too sure.</p>\n<p>Let’s discuss this.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"Command line advertising: coming to a terminal near you!","date":"November 17, 2016","description":"Command line advertisements: enough said!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/command-line-advertising/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/i-built-a-keyboard/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My First Keyboard Build"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/an-unlikely-memory-leak/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Unlikely Memory Leak"}}}}}
